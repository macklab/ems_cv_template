	abstract = {Successful categorization requires a careful coordination of attention, representation, and decision making. Comprehensive theories that span levels of analysis are key to understanding the computational and neural dynamics of categorization. Here, we build on recent work linking neural representations of category learning to computational models to investigate how category decision making is driven by neural signals across the brain. We uniquely combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with drift diffusion and exemplar-based categorization models to show that trial-by-trial fluctuations in neural activation from regions of occipital, cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortices are linked to category decisions. Notably, only lateral prefrontal cortex activation was associated with exemplar-based model predictions of trial-by-trial category evidence. We propose that these brain regions underlie distinct functions that contribute to successful category learning.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: An electromagnetic navigation system for tumor excision in breast conserving surgery has recently been developed. Preoperatively, a hooked needle is positioned in the tumor and the tumor boundaries are defined in the needle coordinate system. The needle is tracked electromagnetically throughout the procedure to localize the tumor. However, the needle may move and the tissue may deform, leading to errors in maintaining a correct excision boundary. It is imperative to quantify these errors so the surgeon can choose an appropriate resection margin. {\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}METHODS: A commercial breast biopsy phantom with several inclusions was used. Location and shape of a lesion before and after mechanical deformation were determined using 3D ultrasound volumes. Tumor location and shape were estimated from initial contours and tracking data. The difference in estimated and actual location and shape of the lesion after deformation was quantified using the Hausdorff distance. Data collection and analysis were done using our 3D Slicer software application and PLUS toolkit. {\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}RESULTS: The deformation of the breast resulted in 3.72 mm (STD 0.67 mm) average boundary displacement for an isoelastic lesion and 3.88 mm (STD 0.43 mm) for a hyperelastic lesion. The difference between the actual and estimated tracked tumor boundary was 0.88 mm (STD 0.20 mm) for the isoelastic and 1.78 mm (STD 0.18 mm) for the hyperelastic lesion. {\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}CONCLUSION: The average lesion boundary tracking error was below 2mm, which is clinically acceptable. We suspect that stiffness of the phantom tissue affected the error measurements. Results will be validated in patient studies.},

	abstract = {Category learning helps us process the influx of information we experience daily. A common category structure is “rule-plus-exceptions,” in which most items follow a general rule, but exceptions violate this rule. People are worse at learning to categorize exceptions than rule-following items, but improved exception categorization has been positively associated with hippocampal function. In light of model-based predictions that the nature of existing memories of related experiences impacts memory formation, here we use behavioural and computational modelling data to explore how learning sequence impacts performance in rule-plus-exception categorization. Our behavioural results indicate that exception categorization accuracy improves when exceptions are introduced later in learning, after exposure to rule-followers. To explore whether hippocampal learning systems also benefit from this manipulation, we simulate our task using a computational model of hippocampus. The model successful replicates our behavioural findings related to exception learning, and representational similarity analysis of the model’s hidden layers suggests that model representations are impacted by trial sequence: delaying the introduction of an exception shifts its representation closer to its own category members. Our results provide novel computational evidence of how hippocampal learning systems can be targeted by learning sequence and bolster extant evidence of hippocampus’s role in category learning.},

	abstract = {Essential oil products are increasingly used in indoor environments and have been found to negatively contribute to indoor air quality. Moreover, the chemicals and fragrances emitted by those products may affect the central nervous system and cognitive function. This study uses a double-blind between-subject design to investigate the cognitive impact of exposure to the emissions from essential oil used in an ultrasonic diffuser. In a simulated office environment where other environmental parameters were maintained constant, 34 female and 25 male university students were randomly allocated into four essential oil exposure scenarios. The first two scenarios contrast lemon oil to pure deionized water, while the latter two focus on different levels of particulate matter differentiated by HEPA filters with non-scented grapeseed oil as the source. Cognitive function was assessed using a computer-based battery consisting of five objective tests that involve reasoning, response inhabitation, memory, risk-taking, and decision-making. Results show that exposure to essential oil emissions caused shortened reaction time at the cost of significantly worse response inhabitation control and memory sensitivity, indicating potentially more impulsive decision-making. The cognitive responses caused by scented lemon oil and non-scented grapeseed oil were similar, as was the perception of odor pleasantness and intensity.},

	abstract = {Ways in which ovarian hormones affect cognition have been long overlooked in psychology and neuroscience research despite strong evidence of their effects on the brain. In order to address this gap, we study performance on a rule-plus-exception category learning task, a complex task that requires careful coordination of core cognitive mechanisms, across the menstrual cycle. Results show that the menstrual cycle distinctly affects learning of exceptions in a manner that matches the typical estradiol cycle. Furthermore, participants in their high estradiol phase outperform participants in their low estradiol phase, and show steeper learning slopes than men in exception-learning. These results provide novel evidence of the role of estradiol in category learning, underscore the importance of recruiting diverse samples in cognitive neuroscience research, and highlight the ways in which cognition varies throughout the fundamental biological cycles of the human experience.},

	abstract = {Category learning is our ability to generalize across experiences and apply existing knowledge to new situations. Many real-world categories adhere to a “rule-plus-exceptions” structure, wherein most items are rule-followers, but a subset of “exceptions” violate category rules. Rule-plus-exception learning seems tightly coupled with hippocampal function. Though past work has demonstrated that prediction error drives hippocampus to form distinct representations of exceptions, limited work has investigated how this process impacts existing rule-follower representations. Here we use a neural network model of hippocampus to quantify how rule- follower representations are altered by the introduction of exceptions. By recording model representations of rule- followers before and after exceptions are introduced, we computed the shift in rule-follower representation elicited by exceptions. A rule-follower’s similarity to exceptions along category-relevant, but not irrelevant, dimensions predicted its degree of representational shift. This work furthers our understanding of how hippocampus supports the integration of surprising information in dynamic environments.},
